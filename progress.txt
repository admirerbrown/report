hurray/..hurray i have finally mastered how to use the basic workflow of git and github by either initializing able
local repository or cloning  a remote repository from github.
finally i can move on to the next chapter in the odin project.
but i will continue with the book "learn enough git to be dangerous" and "learn enough command line to be dangerous.
i am very happy.
